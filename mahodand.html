        <p>Often described as one of the most scenic spots on earth, the Mahodand valley, which lies in the North. 35 km from Kalam, is famous not only&rsquo; among mature lovers, and escapists but also the exotic trout fish hunters. The valley can be accessed through an un-metalled road from Kalam in a four by four (4&times;4) vehicle. After driving for about four to five hours from the vast valley of Kalam, you will enter the wonderful and spectacular valley of Mahodand where the small lakes, towering trees and sprawling pastures welcome you. Some temporary restaurants and hotels have been constructed by the locals. which provide essential facilities of accommodation. They also provide boating facilities in the lakes.The valley is long and wide and touches the border of Chitral in the extreme North. There is a proper track through which trekkers can either reach Shandoor Top or Gizar in Chitral. The river here is divided into a series of small and large lakes. which once teemed with brown and rainbow trout fish introduced by the former ruler of Swat State. Due to over fishing by the locals for dally&rsquo; income and the illegal use of fishing methods i.e. electrocution. dynamiting and large nets.The valley is a heaven for trekkers and provides several beautiful camping sites with abundance of cool water and firewood. But the trekkers are advised to arrange for their own gas cylinders. which will not only reduce the burden on the natural ecosystem but also preserve the deteriorating environment of the valley. Mahodand valley is a true artistic gift of nature for those who cherish such things.</p>
