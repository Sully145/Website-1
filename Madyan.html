        <p>he valley of Madyan is situated about 56 kilometers in the north of Mingora (Pr. Mingawara) city. It lies on the main road that leads to Bahrain, Kalam and other beautiful valleys of Swat. Its riverside location and cool climate make it an attractive spot with rows of shops, hotels and restaurants queued along the road. A trout hatchery adds to its fascination. Local handicrafts embroidery and antiques are displayed at roadside shops.The slightly wider valley of Madyan is different In comparison to other valleys in the sense that almost every type of modern facility and amenity is available here i e. internet, cellular networks, cable and satellite TV, hotels, restaurants and other basic necessities of life.Apart from these up to-date facilities, tall mountains covered with green foliage and dotted with small mud and concrete houses from three sides surround the beautiful town of Madyan. The roaring and foaming river Swat looks like a ferocious monster here as the huge mountains on both sides appear to fetter and restrain its movement.</p>
