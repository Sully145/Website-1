      <h2>Tourism</h2>
      <p>Swat had a thriving economy based on eco-tourism till just a few years ago. Foreigners and locals alike would visit Swat for its glacial lakes, trout fishing and mountain climbing for extremely affordable prices. Most of the local Pashtuns were directly or indirectly employed by the tourism industry. The Pakistsn Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) had developed numerous holiday resorts in each of the tourist sites in the Valley which were very well maintained.</p>
      <p>
      The Minitry of Tourism in Pakistan has now closed Swat to tourism because of the heightened security threat posed by the Taliban. One of the only affordable holiday destinations in Pakistan, the Swat Valley, is not even a shadow of what it used to be.
      Below are the main tourist towns in Swat.</p>
