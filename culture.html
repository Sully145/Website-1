          <h3>What is Pukhtunwali?</h3>
          <P>Pashtunwali is a strong unwritten ethical code and traditional lifestyle for the Pashtun people. From what is told, it has existed since prehistoric times and is still practiced today, mostly in rural tribal areas (most eastern Afghanistan and northwest Pakistan).</P>

        <h3>Why Pukhtunwali?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Pukhtuns inhabit the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan as a major ethnic group of the populace. Most parts of the land they occupy remained independent, and without a centralized government of its own for most of its known history. It is due to the geographical nature of the land, being mostly hilly, that it is not easily accessible and it is difficult to maintain a hold and firm control over it, in the absence of advanced means of communication and other required things, which were not found in the earlier times.</p>

          <h3>Answer!</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Despite the fact that the society remained tribal and individualistic to some extent, the lives and actions of the people had been regulated and ruled by unwritten but well-defined and well-known customs, norms, codes and rules called Pukhtunwali also written as Pashto and Pakhtu, which is also the name of the language of the people. It is a commonly known saying that Pukhtu is not only a language but is also the code, which governs the lives of those who speak it. To an outsider the society might have seemed disorderly, but it was, in fact, a well knit and regulated one. </p>
